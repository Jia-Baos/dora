``` C++
$ dora --help
dora-rs cli client

Usage: dora.exe <COMMAND>

Commands:
  check        Check if the coordinator and the daemon is running
  graph        Generate a visualization of the given graph using mermaid.js. Use --open to open browser
  build        Run build commands provided in the given dataflow
  new          Generate a new project, node or operator. Choose the language between Rust, Python, C or C++
  up           Spawn a coordinator and a daemon
  destroy      Destroy running coordinator and daemon. If some dataflows are still running, they will be stopped first
  start        Start the given dataflow path. Attach a name to the running dataflow by using --name
  stop         Stop the given dataflow UUID. If no id is provided, you will be able to choose between the running dataflows
  list         List running dataflows
  logs         Show logs of a given dataflow and node
  daemon       Run daemon
  runtime      Run runtime
  coordinator  Run coordinator

## Node in Dora

**D**ataflow-**O**riented **R**obotic **A**rchitecture (`dora-rs`) is a framework that makes creation of robotic applications fast and simple.

`dora-rs` implements a declarative dataflow paradigm where tasks are split between nodes isolated as individual processes. <font color="red">So that the nodes can work relatively independently, which can prevent the entire program from crashing due to the failure of a single node.</font>

Each node defines its inputs and outputs to connect with other nodes.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: camera
    path: opencv-video-capture
    inputs:
      tick: dora/timer/millis/20
    outputs:
      - image
      -
  - id: plot
    path: opencv-plot
    inputs:
      image: camera/image
```
